## Ingredients

### Yeast starter

- 250g / 250 mls Lukewarm water / 40°C / 104°F
- 6g / 1 tsp Sugar
- 4g / 1 tsp yeast

### Dry mix

- 180g / 1 1/4 c All-purpose flour
- 4g / ½ tsp Salt
- 4g / 1 tsp Baking powder

### Additional items

- 1 Tbsp oil & 30g / 1 oz soft butter, for greasing the crumpet rings
- 4" crumpet rings

## Method

- Add the sugar and yeast to the warm water, mix well and allow the yeast to activate for 10 minutes until it foams up.
- Add the flour and salt to the bowl, and sift in the baking powder, push any lumps through with your fingers.
- Combine wet with the dry mix then beat the mixture together for 2 minutes.
- Scrape down the sides, cover the bowl, and rest it in a warm spot for 45 minutes.
- Near the end of the 45 minutes, heat up a large non stick frying pan to a temperature of 190°C that’s 375°F.
- Melt butter, add oil.
- Using a pastry brush, coat the inside of one of the rings with the butter and oil mixture.
- Place the ring into the hot pan.
- Spoon the mixture into the hot ring to about halfway up.
- Do the same for 3 more rings, don’t overcrowd the pan, you need space to move the rings around.
- It is very important to keep the temperature correct and constant at 190°C that’s 375°F, any hotter the bottoms will burn before the tops are cooked.
- After 5 minutes the classic crumpet bubbles will start to appear from the edges of the crumpets.
- Once the mixture has dried out around the edges, use your oven mitts to lift off the rings.
- Once you see that the middles are less gooey, you can carefully turn them over to brown off the tops.
- Once golden brown, remove them from the pan and onto a wire rack to cool.

## Notes

    20230520: Make for the first time. Rise time was 75 minutes due to a call. Nice and bubbly mix. Heat cast iron skillet at 1000W, then reduce to 700W to bake.
    Yield: 5 crumpets using 2 4" rings.
    Next time, increase the water from 235ml to 250ml to make it a bit thiner.
