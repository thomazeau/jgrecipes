## Description

Makes 1 dozen. Time: 45 minutes, plus chilling and cooling

## Ingredients

### Filling
- ¼ cup Raisins
- 1 cup Sugar, brown, packed
- ¼ cup Butter
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 each egg

### Pastry:

- 1½ cups Flour, AP
- ½ cup Butter or Lard, cubed
- ¼ cup Water, ice cold 
- 1 each Egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon Vinegar 
¼
## Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, rub butter or lard into flour until mixture is in pea-size pieces.
2. In a small bowl, mix water, egg yolk and vinegar until well combined. Add liquid to the flour mixture, using a fork to combine. Add 1 tablespoon more water if it looks dry
3. Knead dough several times by hand to bring it together and shape into a flat square. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
4. Once chilled, roll out the dough into a 16-inch-by-12-inch rectangle about 1/8- to ¼-inch thick. Flour the work surface and rolling pin as you work with the dough
5. Use a circular 4-inch cookie cutter (or a clean 28-ounce can) to cut 12 pieces. Reroll dough if needed to cut more circles, but try to cut as many pieces on the first pass. With your fingertips, press each circle into the cup of a standard muffin tin, so that the edge of the dough is flush with the pan. Refrigerate while you make the filling.
6. In a bowl, cover raisins with hot tap water to plump. Heat oven to 425 degrees F.
7. Make the filling: In a bowl, mix brown sugar and salt, and then beat the butter into the sugar by hand until smooth. Add vanilla and egg and mix until combined. 
8. Drain the raisins and place seven or eight raisins in each chilled tart shell.
9. Divide the filling evenly among the tart shells, filling each one about halfway. Place muffin tin on a baking sheet. Bake 13 to 15 minutes for a runnier tart and 17 to 19 minutes for a firmer one.
10. A few minutes after removing the tarts from the oven, run a knife or offset spatula around the edge of each tart to loosen. Let cool completely in the tin. To remove, run a butter knife or offset spatula around and under each tart to pop it out of the tin.
