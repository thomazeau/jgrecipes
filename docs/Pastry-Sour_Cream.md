## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup cold butter cubed
- 1/2 cup cold lard cubed

## Instructions

In large bowl, whisk flour with salt. Using pastry blender, cut in butter and lard until in fine crumbs with a few larger pieces.

In liquid measure, whisk water with sour cream. Drizzle over flour mixture, tossing briskly with fork and adding a little more water if necessary, until ragged dough forms.

Divide in half; press into 2 discs. Wrap; refrigerate until chilled, 30 minutes. (Make-ahead: Refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze in airtight container for up to 1 month.)
