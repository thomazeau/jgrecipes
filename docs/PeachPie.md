Cooking time: 55 minutes
Category: Dessert
Cuisine: Canadian

## Ingredients

- **Pastry:**
  - 2 ea pastry for a double-crust 9-inch pie
  - 1 ea egg, beaten
  - 2 tablespoons sugar
- **Fruit mix:**
  - 3 cups fresh peaches, sliced
  - 1/2 cup sugar, white
  - 1 tablespoons lemon juice (optional)
- **Dry mix:**
  - 1/4 cup brown sugar
  - 1/4 cup sugar, white
  - 1/4 teaspoon salt
  - 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
  - 1 tablespoon corn starch (optional)
  - 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)
  - 2 tablespoons butter
  - 1 tsp lemon juice (optional)

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
- Line the bottom and sides of a 9 inch pie plate with one of the pie crusts. Brush with some of the beaten egg to keep the dough from becoming soggy later.
- Stir together flour, sugar, and spices and set aside.
- Wash, peel, and slice fresh peaches and sprinkle with lemon juice.
- Mix together peaches with the combined dry ingredients.
- Turn into pastry-lined pie pan and dot with butter.
- Cover with top crust.
- Flute the edges to seal or press the edges with the tines of a fork dipped in egg. Brush the remaining egg over the top crust and sprinkle with sugar. Cut several slits in the top crust to vent steam.
- Bake 20 minutes, then reduce to 350 degrees F for 35 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through the slits in the crust.
- Cool before serving. This tastes better warm than hot.
- Pie may be frozen for future use.


<!-- Notes 

20230806: Use 750ml fresh peaches + mango cubes. Sourdough pastry for the first time. No starch.
20220529: Use 750ml frozen peaches, sour cream pastry.
20200802: Reduce flour from 1/2c to 1/4c. Use less than 5 cups of frozen, drained peaches. Overflowed just a little bit.
20190310: Sour-cream pastry. Drain frozen peaches before mixing.
20180913: Martha's pastry. 20mn @ 425F, 35mn @ 350F. Enough mix for 4 tarts in silicone moulds.
20171008: Second pie. Make Martha's pastry with Crisco.
20170924: First pie. Use prepared Tenderflake crusts. Bake 15mn 425F, then 35mn 350F. Still a little under cooked, mostly on bottom crust. Used a total of 3/4C sugar, not quite sweet enough.
